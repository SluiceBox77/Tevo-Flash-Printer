# Tevo-Flash-Printer

I found this great and thorough Cura printer profile created by:
https://github.com/luke-saunders/TevoFlash-Cura

Follow his instructions and you will successfully add the Tevo Flash printer to Ultimaker Cura for slicing.

The configuration folder contains the Marlin firmware changes needed to slow the acceleration, jerk and other movements for the out of the box Marlin that comes with this printer.
These are the best settings I have found to work. It will slow down the print time, but smooths all movements to get a good print.
Follow the instructions in the Tevo Flash manual for flashing.
